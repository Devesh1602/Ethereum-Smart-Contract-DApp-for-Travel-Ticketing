# Ethereum Smart Contract DApp for Travel Ticketing

This repository contains the code for an Ethereum Smart Contract Decentralized Application (DApp) designed for buying, selling, and creating travel tickets. The DApp is built using Solidity for smart contracts and Web3 for seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview:

1. Smart Contracts: The core functionality is implemented using Solidity to create secure and transparent smart contracts for travel ticket transactions.
2. Local Deployment: The DApp has been deployed and thoroughly tested locally using the Truffle framework on a local Ganche blockchain. It demonstrates efficient and scalable performance, accommodating up to 150+ users.
3. Integration with Metamask: Metamask Wallet has been seamlessly integrated to facilitate Ethereum-based transactions, ensuring secure and user-friendly interactions.
4. ReactJs Frontend: The DApp features a robust ReactJs frontend with various functionalities, including dynamic fare collection, ticket fare refund, date-based filters, cancellation options, and QR ticket validation.

## Project Structure:

1. contracts/: Contains the Solidity smart contracts.
2. migrations/: Includes deployment scripts for the Truffle framework.
3. src/: Houses the ReactJs frontend source code.
4. test/: Contains test scripts for ensuring contract functionality.

## Getting Started:

To explore the project and deploy it locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using npm install.
4. Deploy the smart contracts locally using the Truffle framework.
